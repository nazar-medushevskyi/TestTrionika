Technologies - HTML, CSS (Less), JS, and the Gulp task manager were also used.
Methodology - BEM.

The page represents a website with information about an event.

There are 5 blocks on the page:

# Header:

A block that greets you when you launch the page.
It currently has one active anchor with smooth scrolling down.
Additionally, when scrolling, the header changes its menu color and becomes sticky.
Other buttons like Telegram, YouTube, and Facebook do not work because a database to which the links should redirect has not been provided.
Conference is mandatory to attend.

A section that provides information about the number of participants, speakers, networking space availability, and the percentage of webmasters.

On the left side, there is a notice about the mandatory conference with detailed information and a slider that changes every 2 seconds with 5 images.

# Sempro 2021:

A block with detailed information where everything is described in cards.


# Moderators:

A small block with 2 moderators for this event.


# Speakers:

A block initially containing 4 speaker cards, a top menu, and a button.
Clicking on the first speaker will display a window with detailed information about that speaker.
Clicking on the "Show All" button will add 4 more speaker cards.
The page has 3 screens: tablet, phone, and desktop. Since this website is not fully completed, some elements may not be fully optimized, such as the header.

# From the context provided in the task:

✅ 1. For the "Conference is mandatory to attend" block: Display 4 images in a slider.  

✅ 2. For the Speakers block: There will be 8 speakers by default, as in the layout. Add a "Show All" button that, when pressed, should display all speakers.

✅ 3. Use a CSS preprocessor (Less, CSS).

✅ 4. Use the Gulp task manager.

✅ 5. Implement a fixed header that becomes anchor links with smooth scrolling when scrolling.

✅ 6. Slider: Automatically switch images every 2000ms.
